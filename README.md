# openglsamples
A collection of simple OpenGL code samples.
I tried to make these samples compatible across Windows/macOS/Linux as much as possible.

- simple.cpp : A very simple textured quad sample.
- capture.cpp : An OpenCV video capture to a texture sample.
- facedetect.cpp : An OpenCV + dlib realtime face detection sample.
- glfwtest.cpp : An example which use glfw as a framework and also glad for ogl extensions.
